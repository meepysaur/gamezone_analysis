# Project Background
GameZone Co. is a global e-commerce company operating in the consumer electronics and gaming hardware industry. The company sells products directly to customers through its website and mobile app, with orders fulfilled via international shipping. Customer acquisition is driven by key marketing channels including direct traffic, affiliates, and referrals, and GameZone serves multiple international markets such as the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

GameZone has accumulated substantial data across its sales and marketing activities. This project analyzes that data to uncover actionable insights that enhance commercial performance and support data-driven decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

1. **Demand & Revenue Trends:** How sales and revenue change over time, identifying patterns such as growth phases, seasonal peaks, and periods of lower activity.
2. **Marketing Channel Performance:** How different marketing channels contribute to traffic, sales, and revenue.
3. **Geographic & Regional Activity:** Where customers are located and how demand varies across different countries and regions.
4. **Customer Purchase & Signup Behavior:** How customers interact with the platform, including how they create accounts and complete purchases.

The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/meepysaur/gamezone_analysis/blob/main/Gamezone_Data_Clean.sql).

An interactive Power BI dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found [here] [link].

Before beginning the analysis, a series of quality control and data-familiarization checks were conducted. The SQL queries used to perform these checks can be found [here].


# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
